betteru website in python and django



1.  Make sure Django 1.5.4 is installed
2.  Make sure cx_Oracle is installed (if using oracle db)
3.  Create local_settings.py with DATABASES updated to correct info
4.  Syncdb is a bit rough.
        run startup_script.bat
        This fixes some issues with creating the models for the first time and generates the views
        also adds the initial data

5.  Make sure inflect is installed.
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/benthor/inflect.py#egg=inflect
        (Requires PIP)



6.  Should work.. Will update with more info later
